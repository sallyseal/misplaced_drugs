# Volume Representations

For volumetric data and (when applicable) for surface data


## Surface

Show triangulation of volume data at a given isolevel or direct display of a surface mesh.

- [surface](../class/src/representation/surface-representation.js~SurfaceRepresentation.html)


## Dot

Render each cell of a volume (optionally filtered given threshold values) as a dot or show the vertices of a surface mesh.

- [dot](../class/src/representation/dot-representation.js~DotRepresentation.html)


## Slice

Render a slice of a volume colored by the value of each cell closest to each point on the slice.
