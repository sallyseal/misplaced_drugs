NGL is an on-line viewer for proteins and other molecular structures. It is intended for users of the web application including a graphical interface and for developers who want to use NGL in their own projects.

## Users

NGL provides a web application with an efficient graphical user interface (GUI) for performing common visualization tasks. A comprehensive set of molecular representations is available to create complex molecular views. Based on the WebGL technology, NGL requires only a modern web-browser.

## Developers

The NGL viewer can be [embedded](./manual/usage/embedding.html) within other web-pages and controlled via a JavaScript API.
