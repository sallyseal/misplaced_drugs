Making a Release
================

Follow semantic versioning and make sure the changelog is up-to-date.

Use npm to update the version number, make a dist build, tag and push to github with `npm version [level]` using the appropriate level (e.g. major, minor, patch, prerelease, ...). Publish on npm using `npm publish`. For the prerelease level use `npm publish --tag next` (to avoid making a prerelease version the default for new installs from npm).

For non prerelease level also update [README.md](README.md) and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and make a release on github including copying the relevant info from the changelog file there.


Development
===========

Development of the NGL Viewer is coordinated through the repository on [github](http://github.com/arose/ngl). Please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/arose/ngl/issues) there to report bugs or suggest improvements.

To participate in developing for the NGL Viewer you need a local copy of the source code, which you can obtain by forking the [repository](https://github.com/arose/ngl) on github. Read about how to [fork a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/), [sync a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) and [start a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).


Modules & ES6
-------------

The source code ([src/](src/)) is organized into ES6 modules (see http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html). The main entry point is the file [src/ngl.js](src/ngl.js) and [rollup](http://rollupjs.org/) is used to create a bundle that can be used in a browser. Before bundeling the code is transpiled using [buble](https://buble.surge.sh/) so that most ES6 features can be used for development.


Building
--------

The JavaScript package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is used as a build tool. The necessary dependencies can be installed with `npm install`. For development, a non-minified build `build/js/ngl.dev.js` can be created with `npm run-script build`. A minified file for distribution ([dist/ngl.js](dist/ngl.js)) can be created with `npm run-script build-min`. For development `npm run-script watch` can be called to watch source files and trigger a rebuild upon changes to them. The documentation can be build with `npm run-script doc`. Tests can be run with `npm test`.


Server
------

The [examples](examples/) need to served by a webserver. Options for a simple development webserver are `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` (Python 2), `python -m http.server` (Python 3) or https://github.com/indexzero/http-server (node.js).


Unit tests
----------

[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) is used for unit testing. The unit tests can be run all at once with `npm test` or individually like `mocha test/tests-utils.js`.
